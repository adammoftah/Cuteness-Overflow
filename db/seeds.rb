  question_id: question0.id,
  body: "JavaScript and Java and very different. Though both of them are C-style languages and include the word 'Java' in their names, their uses and applications vary greatly. JavaScript is a web-programming language used in conjunction with HTML while Java can function through its own devices. "

  author_id: user8.id,
  question_id: question1.id,
  body: "One might want to incorporate Redux into their project when considering scalability as well as unidirectionality of state. React does a fine job of passing information through components, but if you've got a complicated app that many people are going to be using, Redux will enable you to take a stronger hold of the information flowing through your app."

  question_id: question4.id,
  body: "Recursion might get you more clout with your romantic interests but usually will not be the best way to solve your problems, programming otherwise. The time and space complexity of recursion depends entirely on the action you take on each recursive step, but there are situations where you can use steps like memoization to speed up the actual runtime of your application."

  question_id: question6.id,
  body: "A career in tech is certainly a great oppotunity to consider. Personally, I came from a creative background. I studied art in college and wanted to develop my tools of expression further so I pursued a coding bootcamp. A coding bootcamp is a good way to pivot into a career in tech because they streamline the information and skills required to do a job well as well as the skills necessary to even get the job in the first place. Happy to talk about it further if you're interested."

After researching them further I realized that there are actually a lot of different ways you can pivot careers. Even just following free tutorials on YouTube and trying to curate your own portfolio could be a good way to consider a switch. You're obviously a creative and talented thinker, so a career in programming might be a cool move for you!"

  body: "Hey, art and code aren't necessarily as disperate of practices as one might think. The ways I've been able to combine my creative and technical interests have been through creative coding projects. There are some really cool tools like Processing that you can use to get an interactive art piece up and running super quickly. There are a lot of built in methods and make the process easier. Alternatively, languages like JavaScript also afford you a lot of good ways to create art and express creativity that you should look into.

  body: "There are so many ways to make your sound look pretty. To process sound you can look at JavaScript as well as the Web Audio API. Those will allow you to interface with audio through a browser and produce arrays of audio data. To visualize you could look at tools like HTML Canvas or D3.js, both of which can be used to draw the data you receive from the Web Audio API."

  body: "Some tools I've used in the past are Processing, there are a lot of helpful tutorials on YouTube about how to get started visualizing sound. Alternatively, if you're interested in exploring the realm of visual coding, I'd recommend looking into Max MSP. It costs money but you can use it for free if you don't want to save files and are just looking to try things out. It offers a lot of really in depth ways to interface with properties of sound and then use video processing to visualize them."
